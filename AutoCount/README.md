## Feature Goals:  
1. Take in images of (.jpeg or .png form) and count up how many artifacts of each exist
2. Export such findings into .csv format for ease-of-use with excel
3. Be able to view which artifacts were found visually so that a human can calculate the error. Process in given state is NOT perfect but over 80 percent correct.
