# OCR Package
The purpose of our OCR is 2 fold:  
  1. Allow easy-of-use when transfering OCR Data from construction plans into Excel format  
  2. Allow counting to be done via words or letters. (Beta Version --> Works with TextExtractMain) --> Sometimes faster and easier than TemplateMatching Approach
  NEEDS to be converted into class form for ease-of-use. OCR works hands in hands with TextExtractormain()
