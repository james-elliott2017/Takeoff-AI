## Description   
Takeoff-AI harnesses the power of the openCV library with directory management to help estimators quickly finish ripoffs. The end goal is to have a seemless end-to-end product so that non-techsavy people can enjoy the efficiency of programming without having to touch a single line of code or a command line interface.
