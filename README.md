# Takeoff-Main
Takeoff Main Repo which includes all takeoff extraction features

The construction industry requires high amounts of detail, and high resolution data. As with biology, counting is a large part. Inaccuracy's in counts can create large gaps in profit for a company.  

Takeoff-AI's goal is to create an API that is user friendly and solves this very problem from collecting bid documents to submitting your bid. Other aspects of this project include populating the information in excel format so that estimators can quickly use the data in their pre-existing workflows.  

Currently only the back-end is under development, but their are plans to create a PDF-GUI for streamlining the process. In its current state, cropping images with Paint-3D has to be done for searching. Other cropping tools fail, because the cropping has to be done in reference to the image, which traditional tools do NOT do. Most cropping tools rely on monitor-size-references instead of image-size.
