This file serves as the steps to setting up "TakeoffAI" on your own computer

STEP 1: Clone the directory to the location you want.

STEP 2: Install Conda (if not already installed) & create enviroment with the given .yaml file
    .batch files inside Fastfield_Management use "conda activate walker", change "walker" to "your_env_name" if using

Step 3: Create a Projects Folder. For example, the orginal is this.
    "C:\Users\james\OneDrive\Documents\Coding Projects\Python Projects\Takeoff AI\Walker Projects"
    Note: You are NOT required to have the projects folder inside your Takeoff AI folder. I recommend keeping the folder local however, issues can arise if you use an online storage platform in forms of latency.
    
Step 4: Update the following files to have your new project folder path
    a. Takeoff_Main.py --> (img_counts() --> project_dir="your projects folder path"
    b. Takeoff_Main.ipynb --> (update walker_dir in imports cell to "your projects folder path"
    
YOU ARE READY TO USE Takeoff_AI !!!
